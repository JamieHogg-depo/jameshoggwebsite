Between October 2021 and March 2022 I worked as a casual research assistant for a small research project named 'Analysis of biases in aggregated spatial data'. The project was funded by the Centre for Data Science at the Queensland University of Technology. I was fortunate to be part of a large research team which included two chief investigators, two co-investigators, two research assistants, and one external collaborator. My responsibilities in the project included
- Developing a simulation experiment to generate large spatial datasets
- Creating `R`, `bash` and `AZTools` code to carry out the intensive simulation experiment
- Fitting Bayesian spatial models 
- Visualizing and interpreting the simulation results
- Helping to create a shiny app to dynamically explore the results
- Preparing a manuscript describing the work for publication in a peer-reviewed journal
