The benefits in conducting statistical modelling with Bayesian inference has begun to be recognized by epidemiology teams in industry. Having just completed a QUT internship with the Department of Health Western Australia, in this talk I will give details of the wider project and then review some of the modelling and software decisions we made and more importantly, why we made them. Finally, I will discuss some R wrapper functions we wrote that helped to alleviate some of the quirks of Bayesian R packages such as CARBayesST and nimble.
