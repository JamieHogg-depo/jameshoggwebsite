# ISBA 2022

I was super fortunate to be able to attend ISBA2022 in the beautiful Canada city of Montreal. This was a fantastic experience overall, except that I got covid. 

There were some highlights:

* Stan [meeting](https://twitter.com/JamieAHogg/status/1542349690506706944?s=20&t=6iiKHyW8iHtImDpqxV40SA)
* Modular modelling
* Sensitivity and prior choices
* StanConnect2022 (see some posts on twitter [here](https://twitter.com/JamieAHogg/status/1587039993247465478?s=20&t=6iiKHyW8iHtImDpqxV40SA))
