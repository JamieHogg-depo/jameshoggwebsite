Hello there! Welcome to my site. I will be your host; James (Jamie) Hogg, an early career statistician, researcher and music-enthusiasts at the Queensland University of Technology, Australia. This website is an public display of my day-to-day statistical explorations (via blogposts); which may be pointless or pointful, but necessary for my (and hopefully your!) continued development as a statistician and researcher. 

I am currently undertaking a PhD in small area estimation, and spatial modeling. My work will be used in the second phase of the internationally-renowned Australian Cancer Atlas (ACA). Seriously, check it out [here](https://atlas.cancer.org.au/)! 

In addition to my PhD
- I have been a Research Assistant at QUT for a small project on the effects of the modifiable areal unit problem in disease mapping applications.
- I currently work with the Department of Health Western Australia (DOHWA) on Bayesian spatio-temporal modeling. I initially complete a three month paid internship with the DOHWA in 2021 and now work in a consultation capacity on a casual basis.

In general, I enjoy learning new things, programming with R and the tidyverse, and Bayesian hierarchial modeling with Stan. I am a huge advocate of effective communication and enjoy exploring means to disseminate statistical findings to the public to affect real change in public health. 

Outside of research, I enjoy cooking, hiking and playing guitar.
